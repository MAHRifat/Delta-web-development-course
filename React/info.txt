React lets you build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components. 
Create your own React components like Thumbnail, LikeButton, and Video. 
Then combine them into entire screens, pages, and apps.

Write React using JSX.
JSX -> JavaScript Extension Syntax. -> its lets us write HTML directly inside JS.

Working -> JSX convert into babel and it also convert into JS.

* Writing Markup in JSX
    1. Return a single root element
    2. close al the tags
    3. camelcase most of the things


* React Fragment
    -> Fragment let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

* JSX with curly braces
    -> if we use curly braces it will act like pure js 

* React Props
    -> Props are the information that you pass to a JSX tag.

// REST -> Representation State Transfer
    // REST is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services.

// CRUD operations
    // GET -> retrieves resourses
    // POST -> submits new data to the server
    // PUT -> updates existing data
    // PATCH -> update existing data partially
    // DELETE -> removes data

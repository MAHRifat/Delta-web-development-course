Redux
    -> state management library for JS apps
    -> Redux is built for larger, more complex applications
    -> Redux Toolkit is the official recommendation of writing Redux code.

Understinding Terms
    -> Store: A centralized store holds the whole state tree of your application..

    -> Reducers: Functions that take the current state and an action as arguments, and return a new state result. In 
                Other words, (state, action) = newState.

    -> Action: It is a plain JavaScript object that has a type field. (like events)

    -> Slice: Collection of Rudux reducer logic and actions for a single feature in your application
                typically together in a single file.


**** Redux Toolkit lets you write simpler immutable update
    logic using mutating syntex. like push etc....


Provider Component
    -> The <Provider> Component makes the Redux store available to any nested Components that
        need to  access the Redux store.


Dispatching Action  -> triggering a state change
    -> The useDispatch hook allows you to send or dispatch an action to the redux store
        by giving the action as an argument to the dispatch variable.

    -> The useSelector hooks allow you to extract data or the state from the Redux store using 
        selector function. (returns the date)

*** using useSelector we can access central store Component in nested jsx file.
